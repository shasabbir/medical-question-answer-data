    "answer": "hello thanks for submitting your question here. as per the description you have undergone repeated surgery for ovarian torsion where the ovary is preserved. this sounds a bit different as in torsion it is a dictum to remove the whole ovary. now as you are having recurrent pain from the ovaries you need an obg consultation right now. there may be possibility of endometriosis which might present with similar feature. you need to have the biopsy of previous operation and only after few blood tests and clinical examination; a definite opinion can be formed. sincerely dr bhattacharyya",
